Disk Imaging

Disk imaging is the process of creating a replica of the bytes on a digital carrier. Forensic and logical disk images are both options. The first creates a replica of the layout of the bytes from the original media. The second copies the file system data and files, but not empty sectors. Disk images are created when they facilitate viewing and accessing born-digital material. Some legacy file formats cannot be viewed in recent operating systems. Imaging this material
allows it to be viewed in an emulator. Once a disk image is mounted in an emulator, an archivist can view, arrange, and describe the files according to their processing manual.
Transfer

    Connect the power supply to the forensic bridge. Device cables are available in the yellow case or labeled plastic drawers on the bakers rack.
    Connect devices with external power as usual. Uncased internal devices are connected to power through the forensic bridge with a 3M drive power cable or a Molex to 3M drive power cable.
    The forensic bridge should be plugged into a computer via Firewire or USB.
    Connect the blue Host side of an IDE cable to the forensic bridge. Connect the black side to the device. Don’t forget to set the hard drive to single or master.
    Switch everything on. The lights should start blinking.
    Troubleshooting
    Wait at least one minute for the Activity light to turn on. If it does not, turn the Tableau off and on again.
    a. Zip disk drives almost always need to be turned off and on before they will connect. This may also be necessary between Zip disks.
    Check for a Windows prompt or a listing in Windows Explorer indicating the device has been connected.
    a. When imaging legacy media the device might only appear in the FTK Imager drive list.
    b. If the device does not appear, contact Digital Archives staff.

Completing the transfer.

    The Tableau and the device should be turned off.
    Disconnect power and data cables from the device.
    The device can then be put into its record carton.
    The equipment rack holds power and data cables when you are done with them.

Connect the Cables

    Connect the power supply to the forensic bridge.
    Device cables are available in the yellow case or labeled plastic drawers on the bakers rack.
    Connect the device to power.
    Connect devices with external power as usual.
    Connect uncased internal devices to power through the forensic bridge with a 3M drive power cable or a Molex to 3M drive power cable.

Host computer cables

    Connect the forensic bridge to the host computer via Firewire or USB.

IDE device cables

    Connect the blue Host side of an IDE cable to the forensic bridge.
    Connect the black side to the device.
    Set internal hard drives to single or master.
    Make sure the jumper pins on the hard drive are set to single or master.
    Look for a schematic displaying where to place a shunt on the pins or etched labels on the circuit board.
    Research the hard drive model number if you can’t find the jumper configuration on the drive.

Power On

    Switch on power on the forensic bridge. Switch on the device with transfer media.
    Look for Power, Write Block, Host, Device, and, Activity lights to turn on.

Troubleshooting

    Turn the device off and on again if the Activity light does not turn on after a minute. Turn the forensic bridge off and on if not resolved.
    Zip disk drives almost always need to be turned off and on before they will connect. This may also be necessary between Zip disks.
    Check device connection.
    Look for the device under Disk Utility if you don’t see a prompt indicating the device has been connected.
    When imaging legacy media the device might only appear in the FTK Imager drive list.
